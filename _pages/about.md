Hi! I'm Leehee Kim!
I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University(South Korea), advised by Prof. **[Sungjoo Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yxmfPsAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao)**. I am currently visiting the **[Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)](https://hcii.cmu.edu/)** at **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)** as a Collaborative Researcher in **Prof. [John Zimmerman](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman)**’s lab.

I received my Master’s degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://ie.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/index.html) under Prof. Sungjoo Lee. Before SNU, I earned my B.A. in Philosophy, B.S. in Engineering, and B.B.A. in Business Administration (triple majors in Philosophy, Business Administration, and Big Data Science) from [Sogang University](https://sogang.ac.kr/ko/home), graduating Summa Cum Laude.

My research focuses on **technology forecasting** and **AI–expert collaboration**. On the technology forecasting side, I have explored methodologies using patent databases, including patent network comparison for technology intelligence extraction and technology evolution identification using technology, country, and company information. Regarding AI–expert collaboration, I have conducted a review of AI–expert interaction patterns and explored explainable AI approaches to support effective collaboration between experts and AI. 

Currently, I am developing frameworks for collaboration between experts and large language models (LLMs) to support technology forecasting tasks.
