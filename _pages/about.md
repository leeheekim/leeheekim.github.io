Hi! I'm Leehee Kim!
I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University(South Korea), advised by Prof. **[Sungjoo Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yxmfPsAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao)**. I am currently visiting the **[Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)](https://hcii.cmu.edu/)** at **[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)** as a Collaborative Researcher in **Prof. [John Zimmerman](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman)**’s lab.

I received my Master’s degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://ie.snu.ac.kr/) from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/index.html) under Prof. Sungjoo Lee. Before SNU, I earned my B.A. in Philosophy, B.S. in Engineering, and B.B.A. in Business Administration (triple majors in Philosophy, Business Administration, and Big Data Science) from [Sogang University](https://sogang.ac.kr/ko/home), graduating Summa Cum Laude.

My research focuses on **technology forecasting** and **AI–expert collaboration**. On the technology forecasting side, I have explored methodologies using patent databases, including patent network comparison for technology intelligence extraction and technology evolution identification using technology, country, and company information. Regarding AI–expert collaboration, I have conducted a review of AI–expert interaction patterns and explored explainable AI approaches to support effective collaboration between experts and AI. 

Currently, I am developing frameworks for collaboration between experts and large language models (LLMs) to support technology forecasting tasks.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration

NEWS!
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
