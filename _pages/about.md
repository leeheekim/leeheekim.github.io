Hi, I'm Leehee Kim! 😊

I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University (South Korea), advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yxmfPsAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sungjoo Lee</strong></a>. I am currently visiting the <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)</strong></a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></a> as a Collaborative Researcher in Prof. <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>John Zimmerman</strong></a>’s lab.

I received my Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering from Seoul National University under Prof. Sungjoo Lee. Before SNU, I earned my B.A. in Philosophy, B.S. in Engineering, and B.B.A. in Business Administration (triple majors in Philosophy, Business Administration, and Big Data Science) from Sogang University, graduating Summa Cum Laude.

My research focuses on **technology forecasting** and **AI–expert collaboration**. On the technology forecasting side, I have explored methodologies using patent databases, including patent network comparison for technology intelligence extraction and technology evolution identification using technology, country, and company information. Regarding AI–expert collaboration, I have conducted a review of AI–expert interaction patterns and explored explainable AI approaches to support effective collaboration between experts and AI. 

Currently, I am developing frameworks for collaboration between experts and large language models (LLMs) to support technology forecasting tasks.
