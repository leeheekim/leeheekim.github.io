In the field of mobile communication, 6G technology has enhanced features, such as ultrahigh data rates and sharing, bandwidth connectivity, and low data latency, compared to 5G technology. As new services become possible due to these characteristics, attempts to present promising future services based on 6G technology are occurring in academia and industry. However, because 6G technology has a very wide range of applications as a fundamental technology, 6G service scenario research is also being conducted for each sector. To predict 6G technology use in the future, it is necessary to understand comprehensively the scenarios being studied sporadically by sector. Therefore, we aim to derive major service scenarios by analyzing in-depth public data for 6G service scenarios. We collected research papers, corporate reports, and news articles on 6G service scenarios and performed topic modeling to derive four major domains and 16 application areas. Afterward, the derived service's feasibility and promising scenario were evaluated by utilizing the future-context canvas and business model canvas that analyze the service's value from the user's and supplier's perspectives, respectively. The research results are expected to support technology development and business planning in the field by enhancing understanding of 6G service scenarios.
